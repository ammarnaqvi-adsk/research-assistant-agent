## Warm-Up Summary

**Background**: P01 first used Forma 10 years ago when it was called Formit as an alternative to SketchUp. Tried to get their architect practice to switch due to Revit interoperability, but they stayed with SketchUp. P01 then spent 8 years using Revit heavily for construction drawings (housing/apartments). Now works for a City Council doing master planning, so returning to Forma for site planning use cases.

**Key Context**:
- Has only been using new Forma for 2 weeks
- Planning 6 locations initially (60-400 units per location)
- City of 85,000 people expecting 50% population increase in 30-40 years
- Need to show that building inside city is better than countryside (carbon analysis)

## Observations & Key Moments

### Topic 1: Initial Problem & Use Case

**[0:30]** - P01 describes first Forma experience 10 years ago
- Quote: "I first used Forma about 10 years ago when it was called Formit, and I used it just to do some basic modeling, basically as an alternative to SketchUp."
- Context: Wanted Revit interoperability but office stayed with SketchUp

**[1:17]** - Current use case is master planning for City Council
- Quote: "Now I'm working for a City Council, not an architecture practice, and we are doing some master planning."
- Context: Different use case than 10 years ago

**[2:13]** - Why Forma is valuable for master planning
- Quote: "Everybody understands a picture better than a plan. So to be able to show them how the apartments, the basic... and the houses might fit on a site is a very useful tool."
- 💡 Value: Visualization for stakeholders

---

### Topic 2: What Worked Well (Positive Experience)

**[2:47]** - Google Maps integration is great
- Quote: "It was quite good. I like the fact that it is synchronized with Google Maps. So straight away we have a basic topography, you know, there's a hill or... And we have the imagery of roads and the landscape, so that's very helpful."
- 💡 **Positive**: Strong praise for Google Maps integration
- Context: Reduces setup time for projects

**[7:23]** - Setting space in front of houses works well
- Quote: "Normally we do have a 2 1/2 meter space in front of the houses, so that's great that you can set that."
- 💡 **Positive**: Specific feature that matches their workflow

**[14:22]** - Analysis is easy to launch and fast
- Quote: "It's pretty easy to launch. You see the result is fast."
- 💡 **Positive**: Performance and usability of analysis features

---

### Topic 3: Pain Point #1 - Street Parking Not Supported

**[3:24]** - Parking is critical but street parking is missing
- Quote: "The roads and the parking is also very important because they take up space on the ground and the plug in is very good to do an entire parking area like in a basement."
- Context: Setting up for the pain point

**[3:40]** - Can't do street parking (main pain point)
- Quote: "But I haven't found a way just to do parking on the street like in a in a in a row."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Missing feature for street parking
- Context: They have Revit family that does parallel/perpendicular parking and counts spaces

**[4:08]** - Considered bringing Revit family into Forma
- Quote: "Maybe I can bring that into format, just, yeah, I just thought of that. I haven't used that in two years, but that was very useful when I and it would again count the number of parking spaces."
- Context: Looking for workarounds

---

### Topic 4: Pain Point #2 - No Cycle Lanes/Footpaths with Roads

**[4:46]** - Need roads with cycle lanes and footpaths
- Quote: "Could have a road that's say 6 meters wide and then with a cycle lane on both sides and a footpath. So if we could, you know, if it's possible in the future to or maybe there's a way to do it and I just don't know how to do it."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Can't add cycle lanes and footpaths to roads
- Context: Essential for master planning in Ireland

**[5:00]** - Clément confirms it's manual and they're working on it
- Quote (Clément): "I mean, there's a way, but it's very manual. But we are working on something that is close to what you describe."
- Context: Feature gap acknowledged by Autodesk

**[18:43-19:06]** - Follow-up: Line tool doesn't snap
- Quote (P01): "If I wanted to draw a footpath here now what? Because the line tool is great, but um..."
- Quote (Clément): "Yeah, you cannot snap and it's done."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Line tool can't snap, making footpaths very manual

---

### Topic 5: Analysis Features (Positive & Opportunity)

**[8:46]** - Carbon analysis will be useful
- Quote: "Possibly, yeah. Especially the carbon analysis. I think it's because what we want to show is... living close to the city uses less carbon for transport."
- 💡 Use case: Prove that urban infill is better than countryside development

**[10:27]** - Material carbon analysis important too
- Quote: "Concrete versus timber versus steel will be good as well."
- Context: Embodied carbon matters for sustainability goals

**[10:49-11:20]** - Sunlight/daylight analysis important for some sites
- Quote: "Yes, that would be important for some of the other sites... This one here, we're probably gonna put some apartment blocks and we'll want to check the sunlight and daylight analysis there to make sure we're optimizing it."
- 💡 Use case: Ensure apartment blocks get adequate sunlight

**[13:10]** - Planning department needs specific dates
- Quote: "Sometimes the planning department asks for like March and December because they're the average and the worst."
- Context: Regulatory requirements drive analysis needs

**[14:49-15:00]** - Balconies matter for sunlight analysis
- Quote: "Once you highlighted, this is a balcony, this is a balcony, this is a balcony. That's interesting... it would be good to know whether this layout or a different layout... which was better for sunlight?"
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Add balcony support for sunlight analysis
- Note: Clément confirmed this is coming in 2026

---

### Topic 6: Pain Point #3 - Site Boundary Visualization

**[16:00]** - Ireland convention is red line, not red fill
- Quote: "So do you see how the site area is this red color for the entire site? Is there a way so normally in Ireland we show just a red line around the boundary."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Site visualization doesn't match local conventions
- Context: Minor but affects presentation to stakeholders

**[16:40-18:25]** - Clément walked through workaround (line tool + trace)
- Resolution: Can use line tool to trace boundary and hide site limit layer
- Quote (P01): "No, that's very helpful."
- Context: Workaround exists but not obvious

---

### Topic 7: Pain Point #4 - BIGGEST ISSUE - Different Navigation from Revit

**[20:35]** - Magic wand question: Navigation shortcuts different from Revit
- Quote: "I had to learn how to, um, pan using the shift key. Now I'm sure that's something that's fixed and I think I remember it from eight years ago. Um, it's just it's not how you pan in Revit."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Pan navigation uses shift key instead of Revit's middle mouse button

**[20:48]** - Switching between tools is obstacle
- Quote: "So like if people are going to be going from Revit to Format and back to Revit, it would be good if some of the basic commands are familiar."
- Context: Muscle memory conflict when switching between tools

**[21:06-21:25]** - Example: AutoCAD vs Photoshop shortcuts
- Quote: "I couldn't use shortcuts because the shortcuts in Photoshop were different. So it meant I couldn't learn shortcuts in either because I would use the wrong shortcuts. I would use AutoCAD shortcuts in Photoshop... That was Autodesk and Adobe."
- Context: Different companies = different shortcuts, but Forma and Revit are BOTH Autodesk

**[21:50-22:08]** - Obstacle for Revit users
- Quote: "If someone is familiar with Revit and then they're using Forma for the first time, they're gonna constantly not be able to pan and zoom like they do in Revit. So it's gonna be an obstacle for them and they're not gonna like using. They're gonna be uncomfortable."
- 🔴 **High severity**: Creates friction for primary target user (Revit users)

**[22:21]** - Analogy: Steering wheel on wrong side
- Quote: "It's like getting into a car with the steering wheel on the other side."
- Context: Illustrates how disorienting the difference is

**[22:33]** - THIS WAS THE HARDEST THING
- Quote: "But look, you learn it after a week or two. But look, you asked for feedback and **that was the hardest thing actually**."
- 🔴🔴🔴 **CRITICAL**: Explicitly stated this was the #1 pain point
- Context: After 2 weeks, P01 adapted, but it was a major obstacle

---

### Topic 8: Revit Interoperability (Strategic)

**[23:28]** - More Revit interoperability would drive adoption
- Quote: "The like the more interoperability between Forma and Revit, I think you'll get more people using Forma."
- 💡 **Strategic opportunity**: Revit integration is key to adoption

**[23:19]** - Interested in Forma Building Design
- Quote: "I noticed I signed up for updates for former building, I think they're called calling it. Yeah, that'll be great."
- Context: Wants to develop apartment blocks in more detail
