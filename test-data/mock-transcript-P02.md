## Key Observations

### Topic: Onboarding & Learning

**[04:12]** - Quote: "I'm usually pretty good at picking up new software, but Forma felt different. There were so many features I didn't need, and I couldn't tell which ones mattered for my work."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Feature overwhelm, unclear prioritization

**[06:35]** - Quote: "The tutorials assumed I knew certain terminology. Like 'massing' and 'daylight analysis' - I had to look those up separately."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Tutorials assume advanced knowledge

### Topic: Collaboration Features

**[09:20]** - Quote: "The collaboration features looked promising, but I couldn't get my team to adopt it. They said it was too confusing for the time we had."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Team adoption barrier

**[11:45]** - Quote: "We tried using it for one project, but when issues came up, we didn't have time to troubleshoot. We just went back to what we knew."
- 🔴 **Critical**: Time pressure prevents troubleshooting, forces return to familiar tools

### Topic: What Would Have Helped

**[13:55]** - Quote: "A role-based onboarding would have been great. Like 'I'm a landscape architect' - show me only what I need, hide the rest."
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Role-specific onboarding paths

**[15:10]** - Quote: "Also, we needed better onboarding for teams, not just individuals. How do we set up a shared project? Who has access to what?"
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Team onboarding materials
