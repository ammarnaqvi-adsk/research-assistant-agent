(Please include all observations, challenges or quotes that the participants mention during the session)
Task I
Imagine you are looking to use the Forma add-in for Revit. You just started a project in Forma called ‘Emile Anthoine Stadium - Paris, France’ with several proposals in Forma. You have been given permission by your administrator or firm to download the add-in directly from Forma. How would you do so? 
Follow-up questions
	•	From a scale from 1 – 5 (1 being very easy and 5 being extremely difficult) how was that process of downloading the add-in?
	•	Now that you’ve downloaded the add-in, can you please open Revit. How would you go about loading Proposal A from the Forma project ‘Emile Anthoine Stadium - Paris, France’?
	•	Now that the proposal is loaded, can you describe what you see? 
	•	How would you go about changing the project? 
	•	How would you go about changing the proposal from Proposal A to Proposal C?



Monica found the extension and Revit-add-in very easily.
Monica found the load proposal button easily.
Monica understood the hub, but confused the project list for a proposal list. But that might have been a verbal mistake and she understood the proposal selection right away.
Monica noted that this is a much more intuitive flow rather than having to go to the massing section to load proposal. 

Monica immediately understood the concept of choosing the Revit element type for each Forma element type. 

For changing project, Monica was slightly confused about the terminology because while in Revit she assumed “change project” meant change the underlying Revit project, rather than change the Forma project that was being loaded into her Revit project. 
Once it was more clear it was about changing Forma project, she was able to find the proposal dropdown easily. (I am unsure how Monica would have navigated to change Forma project rather than proposal)

Task II 
Imagine you’ve just went back into Forma and added new geometry and vegetation to Proposal A. How would you bring those new changes into Revit? (If they are struggling, ask them how they would imagine it working. Then provide guidance on what the expectation was.)
Follow-up questions
	•	Was this the behavior you expected when clicking the ‘refresh’ icon? 
	•	How would you go about removing Forma elements if you didn’t want to see it on your canvas? 
	•	Thinking out loud, now that the Forma proposal preview is loaded. What actions would you take next?



When prompted to update the Forma proposal in Revit, the refresh icon felt natural to Monica. 

Monica found it very natural to toggle visibility of different Forma element types in the preview. 

Monica seemed to understand the concept of being able to use the Revit project only once clicking the “Convert to Revit Objects”. But she did not immediately understand that the preview was itself not Revit elements. Monica seemed to want to interact with the elements in the preview scene. Again this might just be her tendency to want to click the things she is familiar with and if she had a live demo potentially it would have been immediately clear to her based on UI feedback that the preview elements have no interaction.

The question of which Revit type to convert Forma Buildings to was not an easy choice. (note I believe this is related to next point where it wasn’t clear what “buildings” she was supposed to think about converting)

The question of what the different Forma element types are was confusing for Monica. In particular “Generic” was not a known concept for her. It seems the different between a “building” and “generic” wasn’t as natural to her as the proposal buildings vs the contextual buildings, as that would map more clearly to how she would want to convert them into Revit objects. Otherwise there was no other categorization she was uncomfortable with.


Task III 
Let's imagine that you’re ready to start adding details to the building geometry you’ve imported from Forma. You are looking to convert the Forma layer called Buildings into 'Walls, roofs and floors’. How would you go about doing that? 
Follow-up questions
	•	What would you do next?
	•	Let’s imagine, you’ve made edits to the converted buildings in Revit and you would like to send it back to your Forma proposal for analysis. How would you do so? 


When refreshing load proposal after new elements were added in Forma, there was no confusion about which elements in the preview were new vs already imported into Revit.


OTHER NOTES:

Monica wasn’t clear on what she can do now with the new Revit objects. Given Monica’s familiarity I assume this is largely a limitation of the demo where she only had the option to click through the pre planned paths, and so she wasn’t getting an feedback from Revit UI when clicking things as she is used to.

Monica was not clear on what would happen to her Revit objects being sent back to Forma. The tooltip helped. Her question was around which elements will be interpreted, and especially if it is just the ones in her view or if it is all of them. Using purely views was somewhat confusing, and Monica clarified that potentially using the concept of template rather than a view since that is the more base concept, and then within that the visibility settings are set for what shows up in the view. In general it seems because she sets the visibility settings on the template it made more sense for her to filter based on template. The gap seems to be that the specification of 3D view is required for us, but for a Revit user that is just a specific view mode and their visibility toggling is more based on templates, which can sometimes be on 3D views. 

Monica mentioned she would prefer if the Load Proposal window was able to be docked or smaller. I think this may be related to the UI being not fully available to her in the demo. I think her use case for that was in particular if she wanted to edit visibilities in the view template while keeping the Load Proposal window open. 

Monica missed the vegetation hints available from a satellite view of the terrain which is not what you currently see in the Load Proposal preview.
