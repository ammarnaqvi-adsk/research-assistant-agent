## Warm-Up Summary

**Background**: P01 is an architect at a 12-person firm specializing in commercial buildings. They used Forma for about 4 months before switching back to AutoCAD and SketchUp.

**Key Context**: They were excited about Forma's promise of better collaboration and site planning but found the learning curve too steep for their small team.

## Observations & Key Moments

### Topic 1: Initial Experience & Expectations

**[02:30]** - P01 described why they tried Forma
- Quote: "We heard about Forma from a colleague who said it would revolutionize how we do site planning. I was really excited to try something modern."
- Context: Signed up during free trial period

**[03:45]** - First impressions were positive
- Quote: "The interface looked clean and professional. It felt like a modern tool, not like the old CAD software we were using."
- 💡 Positive reaction

**[04:20]** - But immediately hit friction during onboarding
- Quote: "Within the first 10 minutes, I was already confused. There were too many options and I didn't know where to start."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Overwhelming onboarding

---

### Topic 2: Onboarding Experience

**[05:23]** - Onboarding complexity was a major blocker
- Quote: "The onboarding had like 15 steps or something. I got through maybe half of them and then just wanted to start working on my actual project."
- Context: P01 skipped remaining onboarding steps

**[06:10]** - No clear getting-started path
- Quote: "I didn't know if I should watch tutorials first, or just dive in and click around. There was no 'do this first, then this, then this' guide."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Lack of clear guidance

**[07:35]** - Tutorials felt too long and generic
- Quote: "The tutorial videos were like 20 minutes each. I don't have time for that. I just wanted to know the bare minimum to get my first project started."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Tutorials not concise or task-focused

**Success/Completion**: ⚠️ Completed onboarding partially, but skipped steps

**Key Takeaway**: Onboarding is too long and lacks a clear, minimal path to first value.

### Topic 3: First Project Creation

**[08:15]** - Couldn't figure out how to import existing site plan
- Quote: "I tried to create my first project, but I couldn't figure out how to import my site plan from AutoCAD. I spent 30 minutes clicking around different menus."
- Context: Critical blocker for P01's workflow
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Import functionality not discoverable

**[09:42]** - Error messages weren't helpful
- Quote: "When I finally found the import button, it gave me an error saying 'file format not supported.' But it didn't tell me WHICH formats ARE supported."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Unhelpful error messages

**[11:20]** - Had to Google for help
- Quote: "I ended up Googling 'how to import DWG to Forma' and found a community forum post from 2 years ago. That shouldn't be the only way to learn."
- Context: Lack of in-app guidance forced external search

**[12:34]** - Eventually gave up on importing
- Quote: "After an hour of trying, I just gave up and went back to AutoCAD. It's familiar, even if it's clunky. At least I know how to use it."
- 🔴 **Critical moment**: This is when P01 decided to churn

**Success/Completion**: ❌ Could not complete - abandoned task

**Key Takeaway**: Critical task (importing existing work) was not discoverable, and error messages didn't help. This caused churn.

---

### Topic 4: What Would Have Helped

**[14:10]** - Wished for a simpler getting-started flow
- Quote: "I wish there was a simple guided tour that just showed me the 3-4 things I needed to do to get started. Like, 'First import your site plan, then do X, then do Y.'"
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Create minimal getting-started guide

**[15:42]** - Wanted task-specific help
- Quote: "Instead of generic tutorials, I wanted help at the moment I needed it. Like when I'm trying to import a file, show me a 2-minute video right there about importing."
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Contextual help within the app

**[16:55]** - Suggested a "beginner mode"
- Quote: "Maybe there could be a 'beginner mode' that hides advanced features and only shows the basics. That would have been less overwhelming."
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Simplified interface for new users

## Pain Points Observed

| # | Pain Point | Evidence | Severity |
|---|------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Onboarding is too long and overwhelming | "15 steps", "too many options", "didn't know where to start" (05:23, 04:20, 06:10) | 🔴 High |
| 2 | Import functionality not discoverable | "couldn't figure out how to import", "spent 30 minutes clicking around" (08:15) | 🔴 High |
| 3 | Error messages unhelpful | "didn't tell me which formats ARE supported" (09:42) | 🟡 Medium |

## Positive Moments / What Worked Well

| # | Positive Moment | Evidence | Why It Matters |
|---|----------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Modern, clean interface | "Interface looked clean and professional" (03:45) | First impression was positive - UI design works |
| 2 | Collaboration promise was appealing | "Would revolutionize how we do site planning" (02:30) | Value proposition resonates with target users |

---

## Closing Questions Summary

**Overall impression**: Disappointed. P01 wanted to love Forma but couldn't get past initial hurdles.

**Magic wand question**: "I would make it so you could get started in 5 minutes instead of an hour. Just show me the absolute basics, then let me discover advanced features later."

**Other feedback**: "I might try Forma again if I heard they fixed onboarding. But right now, the learning curve is too steep for a small team like ours."

---

## Quick Synthesis

1. **Onboarding is too complex** - 15 steps is too many, users skip steps and get lost
2. **Critical tasks not discoverable** - Importing existing work (must-have for architects) takes 30+ minutes to figure out
3. **This causes churn** - P01 abandoned Forma after 1 hour of frustration, went back to familiar tools

**Hypothesis Check**: ✅ Supports hypothesis that "users churn because onboarding is too complex"
