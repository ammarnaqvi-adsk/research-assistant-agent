## Key Observations

### Topic: First-Time User Experience

**[03:40]** - Quote: "I'm not an architect, I'm a PM. Forma seemed built for architects, and I felt like I was constantly lost."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Not designed for non-architect users

**[05:15]** - Quote: "The onboarding didn't explain WHY I would use each feature. It just showed me HOW. I didn't understand the value."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Onboarding lacks context and value explanation

### Topic: Getting Unstuck

**[07:50]** - Quote: "When I got stuck, I looked for a help button. There wasn't one in the place I expected it. I had to click through three menus to find support."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Help/support not easily accessible

**[09:25]** - Quote: "The help articles were very technical. I just wanted simple, step-by-step instructions with screenshots."
- ⚠️ **Pain point**: Help content too technical for beginners

**[11:10]** - Quote: "I submitted a support ticket but never heard back. After a week, I just stopped trying."
- 🔴 **Critical**: Poor support response contributed to churn

### Topic: Ideal Experience

**[13:30]** - Quote: "I wish there was a 'I'm brand new, show me the basics' mode. Just hold my hand through the first project, then let me explore on my own."
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Beginner-friendly guided first project

**[14:45]** - Quote: "Also, show me examples. Like, 'Here's what a typical construction PM uses Forma for.' That would have helped me understand if it was even the right tool for me."
- 💡 **Opportunity**: Role-based examples and use cases
