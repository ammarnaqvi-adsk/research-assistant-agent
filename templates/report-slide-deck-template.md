## Presentation Tips

### For Presenters

**Duration**: Plan for 20-30 minutes + Q&A

**Key Slides**: Don't skip Executive Summary (Slide 4) and Recommendations (Slide 13)

**Video Evidence**: Use video clips during pain point slides for maximum stakeholder buy-in

**Focus**: Spend most time on top 3 pain points (Slides 6-8)

**Q&A**: Be ready to show session notes or additional quotes from Appendix

### For Creating Slides from This Outline

1. **Use visuals**: Add screenshots, diagrams, photos where helpful
2. **Limit text**: Each slide should be scannable in 5-10 seconds
3. **Emphasize quotes**: Make quotes large and readable
4. **Color code**: Use 🔴🟡🟢 consistently for priority/severity
5. **Video clips**: Embed or link to key video moments (timestamps provided)
