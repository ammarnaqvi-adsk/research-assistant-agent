## Participants

### Sampling Method

We will recruit participants through **[name the source and the type of sampling method]**:
- [ ] UserTesting.com panel
- [ ] Internal Autodesk customers
- [ ] Social media / community channels
- [ ] Email outreach to existing users
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

### Sample Size

We will recruit **[X number of target users]**.

**Rationale for sample size**:
- **Qualitative research** (interviews, usability tests): 5-8 participants typically sufficient to identify patterns
- **Quantitative research** (surveys, A/B tests): 30+ participants needed for statistical significance
- **This study**: [Explain why you chose this number]

### Inclusion Criteria

To participate in the study, a participant must:
- [Have a specific characteristic - e.g., "Be a current Forma user"]
- [Have done this thing before - e.g., "Have completed onboarding in the past 3 months"]
- [Have a specific background - e.g., "Work in architecture or construction"]
- [Additional criterion]

### Exclusion Criteria

If a potential participant has any of the following characteristics, they will be excluded from the study during the screening process:

- [Name the exclusion criteria - don't just write the negative of your inclusion criteria]
- **Example**: Someone who has participated in user research in the past 6 months
- **Example**: Autodesk employees or contractors
- **Example**: Competitors or their employees
- [Additional exclusion]

### Demographic Balance

The sample should represent a mix of the following characteristics:
- [Add any characteristics that you'd balance here]
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc. (if relevant)
- **Experience level**: Novice, intermediate, expert users
- **Technology comfort**: Low-tech vs high-tech users

- [Include link or reference to screener document]
- See: `memory/screener-questions/[project-name]-screener.md`

## Method

### Methodology Description

We will conduct **[methodology type]**.

**Example for usability testing**:
> We will conduct moderated, remote, qualitative usability tests using think-aloud protocol. In a moderated, qualitative usability test, the researcher provides tasks for the participant to complete on the design and watches their behavior. The researcher is careful not to lead participants by asking non-leading, probing, and clarifying questions throughout the session.

**Example for user interviews**:
> We will conduct semi-structured user interviews to understand user needs, behaviors, and pain points. Interviews will be conducted remotely via video call with a prepared interview guide. The researcher will ask open-ended questions and follow up based on participant responses.

**Your methodology**: [Describe the method and explain it for people unfamiliar]

### Why This Method?

This methodology is appropriate because:
- [Reason 1 - e.g., "We need qualitative insights into user motivations"]
- [Reason 2 - e.g., "This method allows us to observe behavior in context"]
- [Reason 3 - e.g., "Aligns with timeline and resource constraints"]

## Procedure

### Session Format

Participants will join a **[duration]-minute session** in **[tool - e.g., Zoom, Teams, UserTesting]** via their **[device - e.g., desktop, mobile]**.

The session will follow this format:

| # | Time | Activity |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | 15 minutes | • Introduction & consent<br>• Short interview (2-3 warm-up questions)<br>• Set up screen-sharing (if applicable) |
| 2 | 40 minutes | • 5-8 tasks administered (usability test) OR core interview questions<br>• Researcher asks follow-up questions after each task/topic |
| 3 | 5 minutes | • Researcher asks final/closing questions<br>• Observers invited to ask any remaining questions<br>• Thank you & next steps |

### Initial/Warm-up Questions

- Tell me a bit about yourself and your role
- Walk me through a typical day/workflow for you
- Have you ever used [the app/website/product] before?
- [If yes] What do you use [the product] for?

### Tasks (if usability testing)

As many of the following tasks will be given to participants to attempt. If participants finish tasks earlier, they will be provided with further tasks (prepared below).

| Task # | Top Task | Task Instruction for Participants |
|--------|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | [Task name] | [Clear, non-leading instruction - e.g., "Set up your first project site"] |
| 2 | [Task name] | [Instruction] |
| 3 | [Task name] | [Instruction] |
| 4 | [Task name] | [Instruction] |

### Core Questions (if interview)

**Topic 1: [Theme]**
- [Open-ended question - e.g., "Tell me about the last time you..."]
- Follow-up probes: [What made that challenging? How did you work around it?]

**Topic 2: [Theme]**
- [Question]
- Follow-up probes: [...]

[Add more topics as needed]

### Closing Questions

We will ask some wrap-up questions after participants have attempted all prepared tasks/topics:

1. What do you think of using [the app/website/product] for the activities you did today?
2. Is there anything that was particularly easy or difficult for you when using [the product] today?
   - What made this easy/difficult?
3. Is there anything that you wish could be improved in [the product]?
   - Why is that?
4. Is there anything else we didn't look at today that you'd like to share with us about using [the product]?

## Observation

Team members are welcome to observe the live sessions. We ask that observers are limited to **2 per session** to avoid making participants feel uncomfortable.

### Guidelines for Observers

When observing a research session, observers should:
- Join the session **5-10 minutes early** to avoid disrupting when it begins
- Keep **cameras and microphones off** throughout the session
- Save any questions for the participant for the **end of the session** (researcher will allow time)
- Avoid side conversations or distractions during the session

## Schedule

| # | Date/Time | Facilitator | Participant(s) Scheduled |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | [Date/time] | [Name] | **P01**: [Role or info about participant] |
| 2 | [Date/time] | [Name] | **P02**: [Role or info] |
| 3 | [Date/time] | [Name] | **P03**: [Role or info] |
| 4 | [Date/time] | [Name] | **P04**: [Role or info] |
| 5 | [Date/time] | [Name] | **P05**: [Role or info] |

## Notetaking

Team members will be asked to take notes during the session to support the analysis.

### Tips for Good Notetaking

When taking notes, try to:
- **Write one observation on one sticky note** (or one line)
- **Stick to what you observed or heard**, rather than solution ideas or conclusions
- **Make notes understandable to others** (context matters)
- **Use participant IDs** (P01, P02) not real names
- **Note timestamps** for key quotes or moments (for video clips)

### Examples

- ❌ Poor: "User was confused"
- ✅ Good: "P01 expected to find pictures when clicking 'find out more' (timestamp 12:34)"
