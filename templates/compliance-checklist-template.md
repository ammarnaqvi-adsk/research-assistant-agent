  - ⚠️ This is NON-NEGOTIABLE
  - Research Ops enforces this strictly
  - Studies without CRAs may be invalidated

- [ ] **CRA link/form is ready**
  - Link: https://www.autodesk.com/company/contact-us/customer-research-agreement
  - Or use internal CRA form from Research Ops

### Who Needs to Sign CRA?
