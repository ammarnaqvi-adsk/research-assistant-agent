# Research Artifact Templates

## Overview

These templates ensure consistency and quality across all research conducted with the Research Assistant Agent. The agent uses these templates when generating research artifacts.

## Available Templates

|----------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| [research-plan-template.md](./research-plan-template.md) | Creating comprehensive research plans | Goals, Hypothesis, Methodology, Participants, Timeline | `/plan_research` |
| [research-script-template.md](./research-script-template.md) | Generating interview/study scripts | Introduction, Warm-up, Core Questions, Tasks, Closing | `/generate_script` |
| [screener-questions-template.md](./screener-questions-template.md) | Creating participant recruitment screeners | Qualifying criteria, Disqualifying criteria, Sample questions | `/create_screener` |
| [compliance-checklist-template.md](./compliance-checklist-template.md) | Validating compliance requirements | CRA, Privacy, Recording consent, Data handling | `/check_compliance` |

| [findings-template.md](./findings-template.md) | Synthesizing research insights | Pain points, Opportunities, Evidence, Recommendations | `/summarize_findings` |
| [report-one-pager-template.md](./report-one-pager-template.md) | Creating executive summaries | Key findings, Impact, Next steps | `/create_report` |

## How to Use

### Automated (Recommended)
Use the agent commands listed above - the agent will automatically apply these templates and fill them with your inputs.

### Manual
1. Copy the relevant template from this directory
2. Save to the appropriate `memory/` subdirectory
3. Fill in all sections based on your research
4. Follow naming conventions: `[project-name]-[artifact-type].md`

## Template Design Principles

All templates follow these principles:

1. **Autodesk-specific**: Based on Autodesk Research Operations best practices
2. **Beginner-friendly**: Guides non-researchers through the process
3. **Compliance-first**: Includes reminders about CRA, privacy, and data handling
4. **Evidence-based**: Emphasizes linking findings to participant quotes and video clips
5. **Action-oriented**: Focuses on generating actionable insights for product teams

## Customization

Templates can be customized for specific teams or product areas. To customize:

1. Create a copy of the template with a new name (e.g., `research-plan-forma-template.md`)
2. Modify sections as needed
3. Reference the custom template when using agent commands

## Quality Standards

All templates ensure:

- ✅ Clear, testable hypotheses
- ✅ Appropriate sample sizes (5-8 for qualitative, 30+ for quantitative)
- ✅ Non-leading questions
- ✅ Compliance with ADSK policies
- ✅ Anonymized participant data
- ✅ Evidence-backed findings

## Template Updates

Templates are versioned and updated based on:
- Autodesk Research Ops guidance changes
- Team feedback and usage patterns
- Industry best practice evolution
- Compliance requirement updates
