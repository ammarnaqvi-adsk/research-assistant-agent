# [Project Name] Screener Questions

**Research Plan**: See `memory/research-plans/[project-name]-research-plan.md`

**Created**: [Date]

## Why Screener Questions Matter

**Problem**: Without screeners, teams often recruit the wrong participants, leading to low-quality research.

**Example**: Researching churned users but accidentally recruiting active users who still love the product.

**Solution**: Screener questions filter participants to ensure you talk to the RIGHT users for your research goals.

**Remember**: Qualitative research doesn't need statistical significance - it needs the right 5-8 participants who match your target persona.

## Target Participant Profile

**Primary Persona**: [Describe the ideal participant]
- **Role/Job Title**: [e.g., "Architect at a small-to-medium firm"]
- **Experience Level**: [e.g., "3+ years using design software"]
- **Product Usage**: [e.g., "Churned Forma users who stopped using it in the last 6 months"]
- **Key Behaviors**: [e.g., "Collaborate with teams on building projects"]

**Why This Profile**: [Explain why this persona will answer your research questions]

---

## Sample Size

**Target**: [Number] participants

**Rationale**:
- **Qualitative research** (interviews, usability tests): 5-8 participants typically sufficient
- **Quantitative research** (surveys): 30+ participants needed for statistical significance
- **This study**: [Explain your target]

## Screening Criteria

### ✅ Qualifying Criteria (Must-Haves)

Participants MUST meet these criteria to be eligible:

1. **[Criterion 1]**
   - Example: "Currently works in architecture, engineering, or construction"
   - Maps to screener question: Q1

2. **[Criterion 2]**
   - Example: "Has used Forma in the past but stopped using it within the last 6 months"
   - Maps to screener question: Q2, Q3

3. **[Criterion 3]**
   - Example: "Works on building projects requiring site planning"
   - Maps to screener question: Q4

### ❌ Disqualifying Criteria (Exclusions)

Participants will be EXCLUDED if they meet any of these criteria:

1. **Recent research participants**
   - Anyone who has participated in user research in the past 6 months
   - Why: Avoid over-recruited "professional participants" who don't represent real users

2. **Autodesk employees or contractors**
   - Why: Internal bias and different perspective than external users

3. **Competitors or their employees**
   - Companies: [List key competitors]
   - Why: Confidentiality and product information protection

4. **UX professionals or researchers**
   - Why: They analyze interfaces differently than regular users

5. **[Add study-specific exclusion]**
   - Example: "Active Forma power users (if researching churned users)"
   - Why: [Reason]

### 🎯 Nice-to-Have Criteria (For Demographic Balance)

These help ensure diverse perspectives but aren't required for every participant:

- [ ] Geographic diversity (different regions/countries)
- [ ] Company size diversity (small firms vs large enterprises)
- [ ] Experience level diversity (novice, intermediate, expert)
- [ ] Gender diversity
- [ ] Age diversity
- [ ] [Other relevant dimension]

**Aim for balance, not quotas**: Try to get a mix, but don't reject good candidates over nice-to-haves.

## Screener Questions

*These questions will be used to filter participants during recruitment*

---

### Q1: [First qualifying criterion]

**Question**: [Ask about the criterion]

*Example: "Which of the following best describes your current role?"*

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] [Qualifying answer - e.g., "Architect"]
- [ ] [Qualifying answer - e.g., "Engineer"]
- [ ] [Qualifying answer - e.g., "Construction Project Manager"]
- [ ] [Disqualifying answer - e.g., "UX Designer / Researcher"] → **DISQUALIFY**
- [ ] [Disqualifying answer - e.g., "None of the above"] → **DISQUALIFY**

**Logic**:
- ✅ **Qualify if**: Selected option 1, 2, or 3
- ❌ **Disqualify if**: Selected option 4 or 5

---

### Q2: [Second qualifying criterion - Product usage]

**Question**: [Ask about product experience]

*Example: "When did you last use Forma?"*

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] Within the last week → **DISQUALIFY** (active user, not churned)
- [ ] Within the last month → **DISQUALIFY** (active user)
- [ ] 1-3 months ago → **QUALIFY** (recent churned user)
- [ ] 3-6 months ago → **QUALIFY** (churned user)
- [ ] 6-12 months ago → Maybe qualify (depends on other answers)
- [ ] More than 12 months ago → **DISQUALIFY** (too long ago, won't remember clearly)
- [ ] Never used Forma → **DISQUALIFY** (not relevant for this study)

**Logic**:
- ✅ **Qualify if**: 1-6 months ago
- ❌ **Disqualify if**: Currently active, never used, or too long ago

---

### Q3: [Third qualifying criterion - Specific behavior]

**Question**: [Ask about specific behavior or experience]

*Example: "How often did you work on projects involving site planning when you were using Forma?"*

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] Very frequently (most projects) → **QUALIFY**
- [ ] Occasionally (some projects) → **QUALIFY**
- [ ] Rarely (very few projects) → Maybe qualify
- [ ] Never → **DISQUALIFY**

**Logic**:
- ✅ **Qualify if**: Very frequently or Occasionally
- ❌ **Disqualify if**: Never

---

### Q4: [Exclusion check - Recent research participation]

**Question**: "Have you participated in any user research studies (interviews, usability tests, focus groups, etc.) in the past 6 months?"

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] Yes → **DISQUALIFY**
- [ ] No → **QUALIFY**

**Logic**:
- ✅ **Qualify if**: No
- ❌ **Disqualify if**: Yes (avoid over-recruited participants)

---

### Q5: [Exclusion check - Employment]

**Question**: "Do you currently work for any of the following companies?"

*List: Autodesk, [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2], [Competitor 3]*

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] Yes → **DISQUALIFY**
- [ ] No → **QUALIFY**

**Logic**:
- ✅ **Qualify if**: No
- ❌ **Disqualify if**: Yes

---

### Q6: [Demographic balance - Company size]

**Question**: "How large is your company?"

*This helps ensure diversity but doesn't disqualify anyone*

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] 1-10 employees (small firm)
- [ ] 11-50 employees (medium firm)
- [ ] 51-200 employees (large firm)
- [ ] 200+ employees (enterprise)

**Logic**:
- ✅ **All qualify** - use this for balancing sample, not filtering

---

### Q7: [Optional - Interest/Availability]

**Question**: "Are you available for a [duration]-minute video call in the next [timeframe]?"

**Answer Options** (select one):
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No → Don't disqualify but deprioritize

---
