Files with confidential data on their desktops. So if now it accesses these files,
do they stay local or do they, you know, strategy would be like so the
information that you put in it. So that's why I shouldn't put confidential
information. That does probably work. If they access the files, do they become
public one?
Yeah, like if you ask it to read it, it it will have the reference, but I don't think it
will be accessible to people.
I mean, maybe that's a question from there around security things, but I mean
as long as it's clogged within your desktop, it's not gonna translate to anyone
because it's your local files. I think the moment that you put those files into an
agent.
To read and yeah, use, then that would be completely right. OK.
I know, I say that with such confidence though. Maybe we should, yeah, maybe
we should maybe try to define a bit more what we want to do and then try to
find a plan because we mentioned a lot of things like democratizing user
interviews.
Building a research assistant, I guess you have a bit more than that, yeah.
As we focus on that now, like maybe we can mid dive a little bit more.
Right. So that's when you generate, OK, what? What are you gonna do? Am I
just gonna have a conversation with this person? Am I gonna show them a
prototype? Am I gonna like, you kind of want to figure out, OK, what is it that
you want to get out of this? Like, what is your hypothesis about the product?
And what is your outcome that you're looking for?
Yeah, and then the second step, uh, just to give you an example. Yeah, the plan
could be like I want to learn more about like first experience. Let's just say you
want to learn more about churned users. Why don't they churn OK, That's a
very clear, OK. And then you would write task of or questions, OK.
I'm asking questions about trend users. OK, what type of questions could I ask?
OK, tell me the last time you were in a product. What? What do you think
about it? And shouldn't there be like, is the hypotheses part of the research
plan? Yes, because we should. OK, so because I think that's there's, there's, uh,
so there's always goals.
And I have a template and this is the the autodesk. OK, I have hypothesis, you
have methodology. OK, so how are you gonna do this?
You I put this in. You have participants like who are you recruiting? And then
you have like tasks or script.
And then maybe it. OK, I mean, this is traditional. That's why I'm This is why I
don't know. I I think maybe we can synthesize like maybe these two we won't
worry too much about because I feel like that's a bit much.
Then the second part is recruitment.
And recruitment is important because with quantitative research, you need a
lot of people because you need statistical significance. With qualitative
research, you don't need statistical significance if you know it's the right user.
And how do you know it's the right user is that you ask greener questions.
Right. Screen that question again and Screener is like, let's just say someone is
interested in doing this research and then you specifically are looking for
trend user, but maybe by accident there's a user who's that came into the and
they're still using form or they love form.
So that person would disqualify from this research. Mm-hmm. But the issue is
that our team does do not use that screener question. So we can get all type of
users that not may not be high quality ideal user personas. So they're giving us
feedback and we're actually on it.
But they're not the right person. Hmm. So this is a way to avoid that and to get
quality users, which is what we're interested in, right? OK. And then finally
you have like synthesis while you conduct the research, so.
Uh, so that's when you have your like recording and your transcripts and all
that. And then the final one is, uh, synthesis.
So that is like how do you take all the recordings and like make it into
actionable items for the team and then finally like um share out.
So I mean this widely accessible to everybody and everybody can find out
about it. What I'm thinking I can help with the research assistance is
formulating this the research plan and helping with the task and scripts and
then do this portion.
But then could we also, for example, OK and then once we have the screening
questions and the participants defined, could we not use that to target them
with a book sign with a with a colleague, whatever, that's where it could be
interesting. So that's where.
It could be like a. So let's just say someone. So you've identified your
participant and you have people booking it.
You can ask them in Screener to then filter out like which users are the right
users. Yeah, research, right. So yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's kind of
how it fits in the flow. So how do we then need to?
Design the agent we need to we needed to. I think we needed to ask like do you
have a research plan? Yes. No. Like then. Wait, sorry, I'll let you think. I think
you have more. No, but I I think that it's more around the the the guardrails
that we have set in.
In Audit Desk, we don't know them and whatever research plan we make
needs to be adhering to those standards. Yeah, and rules. So the interesting
thing is that this portion is in the streets.
Where Autodesk comes in, it becomes a bit more complex is that we have like
a CRA agreement that they need to sign in order to like it's kind of like an NBA
where like you can't say stuff that you can bring back to your colleagues.
That might be divulged in that interview for a format. Can I change that in our
task force because if they have toggle kind of that you can reach out to them,
do they need to sign that if they'd like any research?
From my understanding is like they they absolutely have to. Like I've gotten in
trouble with not like not not me personally, but like in general. Mm-hmm. If a
research OPS find out that you're not doing that, OK, my point is that is it going
to add?
Barriers or like, uh, no friction. What I find is these CRA agreements, people,
it's a form. OK, people sign. It's not an issue. No, it's just you're agreeing. I
mean, if they don't sign it, like that's them telling you that they're gonna take.
Private information from our company and then give it to other people and
you don't want that. So what do we want the agent to to do for us? Then I
thought it was making sure that our research is compliant with, yeah, industry
standards, but also audit standards like signing the CRA agreement. Mm-hmm.
What is the problem that we're looking for the agent of? So that's where I'm
I'm kind of like like I guess Kumon is the perfect target user for this product.
Mm-hmm. Because you're conducting research but you don't have research.
And without any research background. So I think for you you struggle to
maybe come up with like what is the research plan. I have no idea how to do
that. How do you build a screener question? Yeah. And then what are the next
steps? Like I I think it's the the agent would help tell them, OK, here is the steps
you need to follow.
Have you done this step? Yes. No. OK, yeah, I'll help you do that step. Second
step. Yes. No. And also maybe draft a first, maybe draft the first version of the
research plan. Mm-hmm. No, no, I have a research plan.
And then the agent could help you do that.
Oh, sorry, a template that can be used, but we can use this template and feed it
to the agent if you like. Yeah, help fill this template out. So yeah, the agent
would have the templates and then they can help you fill in every kind of,
yeah, discussing with you what's the goal, what's the hypothesis and then you
have the research plan.
And the good thing is that we could even link it to experiments or hypotheses.
Mm-hmm. So we could say, hey, these are the list of OK Rs that we want to hit.
Like, can you link this research to OK R? And then when we talk about, OK,
now this is going into the bigger portion, which uh, what was the thing?
Kevin, no. Richard was talking about is the repository. So now from here, let's
just say all every team is doing this now, but we need a way to share it out like
with all the work. So we have a repository and then maybe we tell the agent,
hey after the research is concluded tag.
The research plan based on like OK Rs or maybe teams and then like file the
insights into here into these folders so that anyone can access them and maybe
like you could say like I'm interested to know any research that has been done
around.
Around turned users and then you're gonna find Clemont's research and
they'll pull up information about his research. OK, and so maybe there is a
second problem, second and third problem that we want the agent to solve.
Mm-hmm. Which is around the first draft of.
Uh, summarizing the findings. Mm-hmm. And automating the share out
process. Yes, yes. So the three problems generate the first research. We're
recording this. It's recording, yeah. So generate the research plan and ensure
compliance with industry best practices and.
Autodesk practices. Yeah, helping with recruitment with the feature,
summarizing the research and automating the share out. Exactly. And the
automating of the share out could be really great if we could templatize a.
There's different ways to do this. Like usually research teams do one pagers or
they could do slide decks where they would say like these are the top pain
points that came. These are the opportunities and they might deep dive into
each individual like pain point that a user came up with. Like I can't move a
building 5 meters from the road because.
Because the snapping is not precise or or whatever is not precise. And then
you would typically clip a recording. That's where dovetail comes in. Yeah, you
would clip the recording of a of the user saying this is the issue I have because
a lot of stakeholders don't believe you. They don't see a recording.
And then you finalize with OK opportunities. This is the opportunity areas that
you can work with based off these pain points. And then that's how a
researcher would hand it off to a team and be like, hey, I did this research, you
should really focus on these areas if you want to improve the experience for
this type of user.
And then that's when, uh, you put it into the cluster. So trying to to see how it
will look like in it kind of.
Like future destination if you manage to do that. So tomorrow there's APM
that wanted to do research on the specific question. Mm-hmm. He can come to
me for example. Mm-hmm. Then I go to this agent asking about like, hey, I'm,
I'm looking, I'm gonna ask you to search, yeah.
You draft me a research plan and I can connect the research and you get
synthesize and share share this out to a bunch of people. Yeah. Then you
would upload all the transcripts and recordings and be like help me synthesize
like the top user insights and pain points like separate it and I think this is
where.
We have to be very strict about guidelines because AI can start hallucinating.
You have to tell it highlight the the the the pain points and the opportunities
that come out of those pain points only using the transcripts of the videos
inside it and then.
With the findings you could say now create a like slide deck or one pager. Yeah
of all these findings and create a share up on slack and then you check the like
yeah something and here for whatever. OK and then the second part is that in
the back end we could automate it so that like they're always saving it into a
specific repository.
OK, sounds good. Can we? I hope it has been when we called in now 'cause we
saved a lot of things. You want to add something or no, just uh, I'm trying to
look at like.
