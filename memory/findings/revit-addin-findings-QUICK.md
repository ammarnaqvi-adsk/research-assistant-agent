# Forma Revit Add-in Usability Study: Findings

**n=2 participants** (Monica P02, Maria P03) | April 2024

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Both Participants)

1. **Preview State Unclear** - 2/2 participants didn't understand preview ≠ editable Revit objects
2. **Refresh Timing Confusing** - P03: expects "Convert" button to fetch latest, not separate refresh

## HIGH PRIORITY (1 participant)

3. **"Generic" Element Type** - P02: wants "Proposal vs Contextual Buildings" not "Generic"
4. **Download Icon Hidden** - P03: couldn't find, wants Revit logo in nav bar
5. **Workflow Takes Longer?** - P03: "this is taking longer to import"

## WHAT WORKED ✅ (Both)

- Refresh icon natural to find
- Visibility toggles intuitive  
- Element type mapping clear
- P02: "Much more intuitive flow than massing section"

## CRITICAL LIMITATION ⚠️

**Missing Data**: n=2 only (need 5-8). Participant 4 (Sheena) session happened but notes NOT RECORDED. Participant 1 (Jesper) no file at all.

**Status**: PILOT STUDY - directional only, NOT conclusive
