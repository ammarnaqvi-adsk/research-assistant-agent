## Executive Summary

**Overall Quality Rating**: ⚠️ **PILOT STUDY QUALITY** - Directional signals only, not conclusive

**Key Strengths**:
- Well-structured research plan with clear goals and hypothesis
- Appropriate methodology (usability testing with Figma prototype)
- Good task design aligned with research questions
- Effective use of think-aloud protocol
- Evidence of valuable insights despite limitations

**Critical Limitations**:
- **Sample size too small** (n=2 vs. recommended 5-8)
- **Figma prototype constraints** may mask or exaggerate issues
- **Limited participant diversity** (experience levels, demographics)
- **Incomplete documentation** (compliance, screener responses, missing participant)

**Recommendation**: **Conduct 3-6 additional sessions** before making product decisions. Current findings provide valuable direction for design iteration and hypothesis generation, but should not be considered conclusive.

## 1. Methodology Design

### Rating: ✅ **STRONG**

**What Worked Well**:

**Appropriate method selection**:
- Usability testing with Figma prototype is appropriate for pre-development design validation
- Research plan clearly states rationale: "Prototype testing allows us to validate designs before development"
- Task-based approach with think-aloud protocol is industry best practice
- Aligns well with research goals (validate UI, identify friction, test mental models)

**Clear research goals and hypothesis**:
- 5 specific research goals clearly defined
- Testable hypothesis: "The new Revit add-in UI will match architects' mental models when transitioning between Forma and Revit, reducing friction and enabling seamless interoperability"
- Goals directly map to tasks (e.g., Goal 1 "Project/Proposal Management" → Task I "Load Proposal")

**Well-designed tasks**:
- 3 tasks cover complete workflow: download/load → refresh → convert
- Tasks build on each other logically
- Scenarios provide realistic context
- Success criteria defined for each task
- Follow-up questions probe understanding and mental models

**Good session structure**:
- Appropriate duration (45-60 minutes)
- Introduction script covers consent and expectations
- Think-aloud protocol encouraged
- Acknowledges prototype limitations upfront: "Just want to preface that this is a Figma prototype so things may not work as you expect"

**Limitations Identified**:

**Prototype constraints**:
- Figma prototype cannot provide full interactivity or real Revit feedback
- Notetaker for P02 explicitly noted: "This might be largely a limitation of the demo where she only had the option to click through pre-planned paths"
- May create confusion that wouldn't exist in functional product (e.g., preview interactions)
- May miss issues that only appear with real data or complex projects

**Missing quantitative metrics**:
- No time-on-task measurements
- No success rate tracking (beyond qualitative "completed" vs "struggled")
- No standardized usability scales (SUS, SEQ, etc.)
- Some follow-up questions requested ratings (1-5 difficulty scale) but responses not consistently documented

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Continue with prototype testing for design validation
- ✅ Follow up with functional prototype or beta testing to address interaction limitations
- Consider adding quantitative metrics (time, errors, success rates) for objective data
- Document prototype limitations that may affect specific findings

## 2. Sample Size & Composition

### Rating: 🔴 **CRITICAL LIMITATION**

**Sample Size Analysis**:

**Planned**: 3-4 participants
**Achieved**: 2 participants (P02, P03)
**Recommended minimum**: 5-8 participants for qualitative usability testing
**Achievement rate**: 50-67% of plan; 25-40% of recommended minimum

**Impact of n=2**:

According to Nielsen Norman Group research on sample size:
- 5 users typically uncover ~85% of usability problems
- 8 users uncover ~90% of usability problems
- 2 users uncover ~48% of usability problems (estimated)

**What this means**:
- ❌ **Cannot claim comprehensiveness**: Likely missing 50%+ of usability issues
- ❌ **Cannot establish prevalence**: Don't know how common each issue is
- ❌ **Cannot validate hypothesis conclusively**: Too small for reliable patterns
- ⚠️ **Can identify major issues**: If 2/2 participants hit same problem, it's likely real
- ✅ **Can generate hypotheses**: Findings are directional and worth investigating

**Confidence by Observation Frequency**:

| Observation Frequency | Participants | Confidence | Interpretation |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| 2/2 (100%) | P02 + P03 | 🟡 Medium | Likely a real issue, but may not affect 100% of users. Prioritize for validation. |
| 1/2 (50%) | P02 or P03 | 🟢 Low | Could be: (a) affects 50% of users, (b) affects small minority, (c) participant-specific. Cannot determine with n=2. |
| 0/2 (0%) | Neither | ⚠️ Unknown | Doesn't mean issue doesn't exist - we likely haven't found it yet. |

**Participant Composition**:

**What we know** (from session notes):
- Both have Revit experience
- Both have Forma experience
- Both appear to be architects/designers
- P02 has used existing Forma-Revit workflow via massing
- Both appear experienced (not novices)

**What we don't know** (not documented in session notes):
- Revit expertise level on 1-5 scale (asked in screener but not documented)
- Firm size
- Geographic location (names suggest Swedish, but not confirmed)
- Years of experience
- Frequency of Revit/Forma use
- Project types they work on
- How they were recruited

**Missing from sample**:
- ❌ Novice Revit users (screener asked about familiarity 1-5, but both participants appear experienced)
- ❌ Users without Forma experience
- ❌ Range of firm sizes (solo practitioners, small, medium, large)
- ❌ Geographic diversity
- ❌ Varying levels of Revit expertise

**Diversity concerns**:
- Narrow experience range (both experienced) may miss novice pain points
- Both familiar with existing Forma-Revit workflow creates comparison bias
- Unknown whether sample represents target user base

**Recommendations**:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Recruit 3-6 additional participants to reach minimum n=5-8
- Include broader experience range (Revit familiarity 2-4 on 1-5 scale, not just 4-5)
- Include at least 1-2 Forma novices to test learnability
- Document participant characteristics from screener responses
- Consider geographic diversity if product is global
- Stratify sample by firm size if that affects usage patterns

---

## 3. Research Execution

### Rating: 🟡 **ADEQUATE WITH GAPS**

**What Went Well**:

**Task completion**:
- ✅ Both participants completed all 3 tasks
- ✅ Sessions appear to have followed planned structure
- ✅ Notetakers captured observations, quotes, and context
- ✅ Think-aloud protocol appears to have been used effectively

**Facilitation quality**:
- Research lead (Tamira McCoy) guided participants through tasks
- Appropriate prompting when participants struggled
- Follow-up questions asked as planned
- Participants felt comfortable providing critical feedback

**Documentation**:
- Observations captured chronologically by task
- Direct quotes included
- Notetaker interpretations flagged ("I think this may be...")
- Behavioral observations noted (not just verbal responses)

**Execution Gaps**:

**Missing participant (P01)**:
- ❌ Research plan lists Jesper Staahl as participant, but no session notes provided
- ❌ Not clear if session was conducted but not documented, or if participant didn't complete
- Impact: Reduces sample size from planned 3 to achieved 2

**Missing 4th participant**:
- ⚠️ Plan noted "Potential 4th participant TBD" - never conducted or documented
- Impact: Missed opportunity to reach minimum recommended sample size

**Incomplete follow-up question responses**:
- ⚠️ P03 was asked difficulty rating (1-5 scale) for downloading add-in but "didn't give an actual score"
- Facilitator didn't probe further or ask participant to choose a number
- Other quantitative ratings may be missing

**Screener responses not documented**:
- ❌ Research plan includes 5 screening questions, but responses not in session notes
- Missing context: Revit familiarity (1-5), prior Forma add-in use, magic wand improvement wish
- Impact: Can't assess if participants matched target criteria or identify recruitment issues

**Session metadata incomplete**:
- ❌ Recording status not documented (was session recorded? consent obtained?)
- ❌ Actual session duration not documented (just "~45-60 minutes" planned)
- ❌ Technical issues not mentioned (did prototype work smoothly?)

**Recommendations**:
- Document all planned sessions (note if participant dropped out or session cancelled)
- Probe when participants don't provide requested ratings (or remove question if not important)
- Include screener responses in session notes for context
- Create session metadata checklist: duration, recording status, technical issues, consent obtained
- Debrief after each session to capture facilitator observations

---

## 4. Data Quality

### Rating: 🟡 **ADEQUATE FOR DIRECTIONAL INSIGHTS**

**Strengths**:

**Rich observational notes**:
- Notetakers captured not just what participants said, but behaviors and reactions
- Quotes appear to be verbatim or close paraphrases
- Context provided for observations
- Facilitator/notetaker interpretations flagged separately from participant actions

**Evidence-based documentation**:
- Specific examples cited
- Chronological flow preserved
- Success/failure noted for each task
- Both positive moments and pain points captured

**Notetaker perspective**:
- P02's notetaker (Nicholas Ragonese) provided helpful interpretations: "I believe this is related to..." / "I am unsure how Monica would have navigated..."
- P03's notetaker (Zhou Fang) used clear formatting and captured specific suggestions

**Limitations**:

**No recordings or transcripts**:
- ❌ No documentation of whether sessions were recorded
- ❌ No transcripts provided for verbatim analysis
- Impact: Can't verify quote accuracy or review moments in detail
- Impact: Can't create video clips for stakeholder presentations
- Impact: Relies entirely on notetaker capture (subject to bias/gaps)

**Notetaker interpretation vs. participant voice**:
- Session notes include notetaker inferences that aren't always clearly separated
- Example (P02): "Monica seemed to understand the concept of being able to use the Revit project only once clicking the 'Convert to Revit Objects'. But she did not immediately understand that the preview was itself not Revit elements."
- Question: Did Monica say this, or is it notetaker inference from behavior?

**Inconsistent detail levels**:
- P02's notes provide detailed narrative and context
- P03's notes are more bullet-point format with less connective narrative
- Some sections very detailed, others sparse

**Missing quantitative data**:
- No time-on-task measurements
- No error counts
- Inconsistent difficulty ratings (P03 asked but didn't provide score)
- No standardized usability metrics

**Prototype artifact risk**:
- Some observations may be artifacts of Figma prototype limitations rather than design issues
- P02's notetaker explicitly acknowledged this: "Given Monica's familiarity I assume this is largely a limitation of the demo"
- Hard to separate prototype issues from design issues without functional testing

**Recommendations**:
- Record all future sessions (with consent) for verbatim transcription
- Create video clips of key moments for stakeholder sharing
- Establish notetaking template separating observations from interpretations
- Add quantitative metrics to supplement qualitative insights
- Test with functional prototype to isolate design issues from prototype limitations
- Consider observer triangulation (multiple notetakers) for critical sessions

## 5. Compliance & Ethics

### Rating: ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**

**Compliance Status**:

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Risk |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|
| CRA Agreement | ❓ Unknown | Not documented in session notes | 🔴 High if external participants |
| Recording Consent | ❓ Unknown | Not documented; script mentions asking but no confirmation | 🟡 Medium |
| PII Anonymization | ⚠️ Partial | Real names used in session notes but participant IDs assigned | 🟢 Low (fixable) |
| Data Storage | ❓ Unknown | Not documented where recordings/notes stored | 🟡 Medium |
| Incentive Compliance | ❓ Unknown | Not documented if participants were compensated | 🟢 Low |

**What We Know**:

**Recording consent in script**:
- ✅ Session script includes: "Is it alright if we record this session for internal sharing purposes?"
- ⚠️ No documentation in session notes confirming verbal consent was obtained
- ⚠️ No documentation of whether sessions were actually recorded

**Participant type acknowledgment**:
- Research plan includes participant handling: "Internal users (Autodesk employees/IEs): Thank via Slack" / "External users: Gift card incentive, follow-up email"
- ❓ Not documented whether P02 and P03 were internal or external
- Impact on compliance: External requires CRA agreement (critical), internal does not

**PII handling**:
- Session notes use real names (Monica Pereira Da Silva, Maria Johansson)
- Findings document properly uses participant IDs (P02, P03)
- ⚠️ Session notes need sanitization before external sharing

**CRA status**:
- Research plan notes: "CRA Status: ❓ Not documented in plan (assumed for internal/IE participants, unclear for external)"
- ❌ No confirmation in session notes whether CRAs were signed
- ⚠️ Critical gap if participants were external

**What We Don't Know**:

❌ Were participants internal (Autodesk employees) or external?
❌ If external, did they sign CRA agreements?
❌ Were sessions actually recorded?
❌ If recorded, was explicit consent obtained and documented?
❌ Where are recordings stored? (secure location required)
❌ How long will data be retained?
❌ Were participants compensated? (incentive policy compliance)

**Risk Assessment**:

**If participants were internal/IEs**:
- Risk: 🟢 Low - CRA not required, recording for internal use acceptable with consent
- Still needed: Recording consent documentation, PII anonymization for sharing

**If participants were external**:
- Risk: 🔴 High - CRA required for Autodesk Research Ops compliance
- Impact: Research Ops may flag study; findings could be invalidated
- Needed: CRA signed before sessions, recording consent, data handling procedures

**Recommendations**:

**Immediate actions**:
- 🔴 **Confirm participant type**: Were P02 and P03 internal or external?
- 🔴 **If external**: Verify CRA agreements were signed; retroactively obtain if possible
- 🟡 **Confirm recording consent**: Review recordings or facilitator notes to verify consent was obtained
- 🟡 **Sanitize session notes**: Remove real names before sharing externally (replace with P02/P03)
- 🟢 **Document data storage**: Confirm recordings are in secure, compliant location

**Future sessions**:
- Create compliance checklist completed at start of each session
- Document CRA signature date in session notes
- Document explicit recording consent (timestamp or written confirmation)
- Use participant IDs from start (never record real names if sharing beyond core team)
- Clarify data retention policy (typically 2-3 years)

**For remaining 3-6 sessions needed**:
- ✅ Obtain CRA before session starts (if external participants)
- ✅ Obtain explicit recording consent and document in session notes
- ✅ Use only participant IDs in all documentation from day 1
- ✅ Store recordings securely and document location
- ✅ Complete compliance checklist for each session

## 8. Overall Confidence Assessment

### Rating: 🟡 **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - DIRECTIONAL ONLY**

**Confidence by Finding Type**:

| Finding Category | Confidence Level | Rationale | Use Case |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Issues affecting 2/2 participants** | 🟡 Medium | Likely real issues, but prevalence unknown. May not affect 100% of users. | Prioritize for investigation in additional sessions. Worth addressing in design iteration. |
| **Issues affecting 1/2 participants** | 🟢 Low | Could affect 50% of users, or 5%, or be participant-specific. Can't determine with n=2. | Treat as hypothesis. Monitor in additional sessions. Don't prioritize highly unless severity is extreme. |
| **Positive findings (2/2)** | 🟡 Medium | Likely strengths, but may not be universally appreciated. | Preserve in redesign, but validate with more users. |
| **Hypothesis validation** | 🟢 Low | "Partially supported" based on n=2 is highly uncertain. | Treat as preliminary signal only. Reserve final conclusion for n=5-8. |
| **Missing issues (0/2)** | ⚠️ Unknown | With n=2, likely missing ~50% of usability issues. | Expect significant new findings with additional participants. |

**Confidence-Based Recommendations**:

**High Confidence Actions** (Safe to act on now):
1. ✅ **Iterate designs** addressing 2/2 participant issues (Generic label, preview state, project switching)
2. ✅ **Preserve strengths** observed in 2/2 participants (refresh icon, visibility toggles, element mapping)
3. ✅ **Prepare for additional testing** with 3-6 more participants
4. ✅ **Generate hypotheses** for broader validation

**Medium Confidence Actions** (Investigate further):
1. ⚠️ **Monitor 1/2 issues** in additional sessions (templates vs views, refresh timing, download location)
2. ⚠️ **Prototype recommended fixes** for high-priority issues to test in next round
3. ⚠️ **Validate terminology** changes with quick study before full implementation

**Low Confidence Actions** (Wait for more data):
1. ❌ **Don't make go/no-go decisions** on development without additional research
2. ❌ **Don't finalize priorities** based on current frequency data
3. ❌ **Don't claim hypothesis is validated** (or rejected) conclusively
4. ❌ **Don't implement major workflow changes** without validating with n=5-8

**Decision-Making Framework**:

| Decision Type | Can Make Now? | Evidence Needed |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Iterate designs addressing 2/2 issues | ✅ Yes | Current findings sufficient for design iteration |
| Proceed with development of current design | ❌ No | Need n=5-8 validation before development investment |
| Prioritize features/improvements | ⚠️ Partial | Can prioritize 2/2 issues; need more data for 1/2 issues |
| Claim hypothesis validated | ❌ No | Need minimum n=5 for qualitative validation |
| Make resource allocation decisions | ❌ No | Need cost/benefit and broader validation |
| Share findings as directional insights | ✅ Yes | With appropriate caveats about sample size |
| Test prototype fixes in next round | ✅ Yes | Iterative testing with small samples is valid |

**What This Study Successfully Achieved**:

## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Product Decisions)

**1. Conduct 3-6 Additional Sessions** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Why**: Current n=2 is insufficient for conclusive findings
- **Target**: Reach minimum n=5-8 for qualitative usability testing
- **Focus**: Test refined designs addressing 2/2 participant issues
- **Timeline**: Before making development go/no-go decision

**2. Diversify Participant Sample** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Why**: Current sample limited to experienced users
- **Include**: Range of Revit expertise (2-5 on familiarity scale), Forma novices, different firm sizes
- **Document**: Screener responses, participant characteristics
- **Timeline**: In additional sessions

**3. Resolve Compliance Documentation** 🔴 CRITICAL (if external participants)
- **Why**: CRA agreement required for external participants; Research Ops enforces strictly
- **Action**: Confirm participant type; verify CRA signatures; obtain retroactively if possible
- **Document**: CRA status, recording consent in session notes
- **Timeline**: Immediately

**4. Test with Functional Prototype or Beta** 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Why**: Separate Figma prototype artifacts from real design issues
- **Action**: Conduct follow-up testing with interactive prototype or beta product
- **Validate**: Issues like preview confusion, refresh timing with real Revit feedback
- **Timeline**: After initial design iteration, before full development

**5. Sanitize Session Notes for Sharing** 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Why**: Real names should not be shared beyond core team
- **Action**: Replace Monica Pereira Da Silva → P02, Maria Johansson → P03 in all shared documents
- **Impact**: Enables compliant sharing with stakeholders
- **Timeline**: Before sharing beyond research team

### Design Iteration Recommendations

**Safe to Implement** (Based on 2/2 participants):
1. ✅ Replace "Generic" element type label with context-based categorization
2. ✅ Add clear preview state indicators ("PREVIEW" label, visual treatment)
3. ✅ Add project switching affordance (dropdown or back button)
4. ✅ Consider real-time preview updates (if technically feasible)

**Validate Before Implementing** (Based on 1/2 participants):
1. ⚠️ Templates vs. views for sending to Forma (test with more users, investigate technical constraints)
2. ⚠️ Combining refresh into conversion action (validate workflow preference)
3. ⚠️ Add-in download location and branding (test discoverability)
4. ⚠️ Terminology changes (quick validation study with 10-15 users)
