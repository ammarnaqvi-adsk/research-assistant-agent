**Study**: Forma Revit Add-in Enhancement
**Date**: April 10-11, 2024
**Participants**: 2 (P02: Monica, P03: Maria)
**Methodology**: Usability Testing - Figma Prototype

⚠️ **SAMPLE SIZE LIMITATION**: n=2 participants (recommended 5-8 for qualitative). Findings are directional only.

## Top Pain Points (Cross-Participant)

### 1. Preview State Not Clearly Distinguished
**Evidence**:
- P02: "Did not immediately understand preview was NOT Revit elements"
- P03: "Not understanding from dialog screen to know for sure this is a preview screen"

**Frequency**: 2/2 participants (100%)
**Severity**: 🔴 High
**Confidence**: 🟡 Medium (n=2)

**Opportunity**: Add clear "Preview" label/header + visual distinction for non-interactive elements

---

### 2. "Generic" Element Type Unclear
**Evidence**:
- P02: "'Generic' was not a known concept", wanted "Proposal Buildings vs Contextual Buildings"

**Frequency**: 1/2 participants (50%)
**Severity**: 🔴 High
**Confidence**: 🟢 Low (n=2, only 1 mentioned)

**Opportunity**: Replace "Generic" with context-based categorization

---

### 3. Download Icon Hard to Find
**Evidence**:
- P03: "Difficulty finding icon to download", looked in nav bar, analysis bar, dots menu

**Frequency**: 1/2 participants (50%)
**Severity**: 🔴 High
**Confidence**: 🟢 Low (n=2)

**Opportunity**: Add Revit icon to navigation bar

---

## What Worked Well (2/2 participants)

1. **New workflow more intuitive** - P02: "Much more intuitive flow than massing section"
2. **Refresh icon natural** - Both found refresh easily
3. **Visibility toggles** - Both found unchecking boxes intuitive
4. **Element mapping concept** - P02: "Immediately understood" Revit type selection

---

## Quick Recommendations

🔴 **High**: Add preview state indicator, reconsider "Generic" label, improve download discoverability
🟡 **Medium**: Real-time preview updates, project switching, search/folders for long lists
🟢 **Low**: Individual building selection, Forma-Revit link indicator

**CRITICAL**: Run 3-6 more sessions to reach minimum n=5 sample size before final decisions.
