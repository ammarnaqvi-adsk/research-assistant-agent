# Research Repository

## Overview

This is the central research repository for all user research conducted with the Research Assistant Agent. All research artifacts are organized here for easy discovery and reuse across teams.

## Organization

Your research artifacts are organized as:

```
memory/
├── research-plans/             # All research plans with goals, hypotheses, methodologies
├── research-scripts/           # Interview/study scripts generated from plans
├── screener-questions/         # Participant recruitment screeners
├── compliance/                 # Compliance checklists (CRA, privacy, recording consent)
├── session-notes/              # Raw transcripts and notes from research sessions
├── findings/                   # Synthesized findings (pain points, opportunities, recommendations)
└── reports/                    # Shareable reports (one-pagers, slide decks)
```

## How to Use

1. **Start new research**: Use `/plan_research` to create a research plan
2. **Generate artifacts**: Use commands to create scripts, screeners, and compliance checks
3. **Conduct sessions**: Add session notes to `session-notes/[project-name]/`
4. **Synthesize findings**: Use `/summarize_findings` to generate insights
5. **Share insights**: Use `/create_report` to generate shareable formats

- **Completed**: 0
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Total Participants**: 0
- **Total Findings**: 0

## Best Practices

- **Name files descriptively**: Use `[project-name]-[artifact-type].md` format
- **Tag everything**: Add OKR, team, and topic tags to enable search
- **Keep transcripts anonymized**: Use participant IDs (P01, P02) not real names
- **Link findings to evidence**: Reference specific quotes and video timestamps
- **Update this index**: Agent automatically updates as you create research

## Compliance Reminders

- ✅ All participants must sign CRA before research
- ✅ Obtain explicit recording consent
- ✅ Anonymize PII in all findings and reports
- ✅ Follow data retention policies
