# Research Plan: Forma Add-in for Revit Usability Testing

**Project**: Forma Revit Add-in Enhancement

**Date**: Week of April 8th, 2024

**Research Lead**: Tamira McCoy (UX Designer, Connected Clients team)

**Methodology**: Usability Testing (Figma Prototype Walkthrough)

---

## Background & Context

As we begin the year after the FY25 planning, it was clear that there is an increased interest in creating better interoperability between Forma and the rest of the AEC design products. The enhancement of the Revit add-in is the focus for Q1 to allow for a seamless workflow in managing Forma elements in Revit and sending Revit objects back into Forma for analysis.

### Target Workflows to Unlock

**For Architects**:
- Allow architects to load Forma projects + proposals from within Revit
- Allow user-initiated conversions from Forma elements to Revit elements/families
- Easily preview Forma proposals in Revit
- Seamlessly upload Revit elements to Forma proposals for additional analysis

**For Forma Product**:
- Enable Forma project and proposal creation from within Revit
- Build workflows in Revit that unlock Forma analysis features
- Embed Forma into legacy workflows to increase adoption as part of early-stage design + analysis

---

## Research Goals

Determine if the new approach to the Revit add-in designs satisfies the following criteria:

1. **Project/Proposal Management**: Users can select, swap and load desired Forma projects & proposals
2. **Preview Understanding**: Users understand how previewing works and the implications of converting Forma layers
3. **Conversion Options**: Users can easily identify the design options for each Forma element and generate desired Revit object conversion from those options
4. **Update Workflow**: Users can identify how to update Forma proposals through the add-in
5. **Linking Management**: Users can unlink and re-link desired Forma proposals

---

## Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: The new Revit add-in UI will match architects' mental models when transitioning between Forma and Revit, reducing friction and enabling seamless interoperability.

**What we believe**:
- Architects expect to manage Forma content from within Revit (not switching back to Forma)
- Preview before conversion will help users understand what they're importing
- Clear conversion options will reduce confusion about Forma vs. Revit elements

---

## Methodology

**Method**: Usability Testing with Figma Prototype

**Rationale**:
- Prototype testing allows us to validate designs before development
- Task-based testing reveals whether UI matches user mental models
- Think-aloud protocol captures confusion points and delightful moments

**Session Format**:
- Duration: ~45-60 minutes
- Remote sessions with screen sharing
- Figma prototype walkthrough (not live product)
- 3 structured tasks with follow-up questions
- Think-aloud protocol

## Participants

**Target Sample Size**: 3-4 participants

**Participants Planned**:
1. Jesper Staahl
2. Monica Pereira Da Silva
3. Maria Johansson
4. (Potential 4th participant TBD)

### Inclusion Criteria
- Has used Revit before
- Architect or designer role
- Familiar with Forma (or willing to learn)
- Access to Revit add-in workflow

### Exclusion Criteria
- No Revit experience
- Not in architecture/design field

### Screening Questions
1. Have you used Revit before?
2. If yes, what types of projects did you use it for?
3. From a scale of 1-5 (1 being not familiar at all and 5 being extremely familiar), how would you rate your knowledge of Revit?
4. Have you used the Forma add-in for Revit before?
5. If you had a magic wand, what is one thing that you would love to see improved in the existing Forma <> Revit workflow?

## Tasks

### Task I: Download Add-in and Load Proposal

**Scenario**: "Imagine you are looking to use the Forma add-in for Revit. You just started a project in Forma called 'Emile Anthoine Stadium - Paris, France' with several proposals in Forma. You have been given permission by your administrator or firm to download the add-in directly from Forma. How would you do so?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
- From a scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy and 5 being extremely difficult) how was that process of downloading the add-in?
- Now that you've downloaded the add-in, can you please open Revit. How would you go about loading Proposal A from the Forma project 'Emile Anthoine Stadium - Paris, France'?
- Now that the proposal is loaded, can you describe what you see?
- How would you go about changing the project?
- How would you go about changing the proposal from Proposal A to Proposal C?

**Success Criteria**:
- User can locate add-in download within Forma
- User can load proposal from within Revit add-in panel
- User understands what's displayed in preview
- User can switch between projects and proposals

---

### Task II: Refresh Proposal with New Changes

**Scenario**: "Imagine you've just went back into Forma and added new geometry and vegetation to Proposal A. How would you bring those new changes into Revit?"

*(If they are struggling, ask them how they would imagine it working. Then provide guidance on what the expectation was.)*

**Follow-up Questions**:
- If they hit 'refresh': Was this the behavior you expected when clicking the 'refresh' icon?
- How would you go about removing Forma elements if you didn't want to see it on your canvas?
- Thinking out loud, now that the Forma proposal preview is loaded. What actions would you take next?

**Success Criteria**:
- User finds refresh functionality
- User understands refresh behavior (preview updates)
- User can toggle visibility of Forma element types

---

### Task III: Convert Forma Elements to Revit Objects

**Scenario**: "Let's imagine that you're ready to start adding details to the building geometry you've imported from Forma. You are looking to convert the Forma layer called Buildings into 'Walls, roofs and floors'. How would you go about doing that?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
- What would you do next?
- Let's imagine, you've made edits to the converted buildings in Revit and you would like to send it back to your Forma proposal for analysis. How would you do so?

**Success Criteria**:
- User can locate conversion options for Forma elements
- User can select desired Revit element types (walls, roofs, floors)
- User understands how to send Revit objects back to Forma for analysis

## Script

### Introduction

"Hi, my name is Tamira. I am the UX designer on the Connected Clients team. I will be walking you through a Figma prototype that I have put together that showcases the Forma add-in designs for Revit.

In today's conversations, our team is looking to learn if this new workflow satisfies some of the desired improvements to the product. We would like to determine if the new features and content we're providing matches an architect's mental model when they transition from Forma into Revit (and then back to Forma).

The information will help us determine whether we need to modify, add or change any of the designs prior to sending it to development."

### Task Introduction

"In today's session, I will be giving you several tasks for you to complete. This is not a test of your ability to use the new features. If you have any questions along the way, please ask me. I may or may not answer them until the end of the session because we are interested in how people do when they don't have assistance.

While you work on these tasks, try to describe what you are doing and what's going through your mind. This could be things that you like or don't like, areas of the add-in that are confusing, delightful moments such as features or designs that you did enjoy.

Just want to preface that this is a Figma prototype so things may not work as you expect. Use it as however you'd use it. If something doesn't work, we will know.

Before we get started, do you have any questions? Is it alright if we record this session for internal sharing purposes?"
